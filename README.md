Using Databases, Java FX and Gradle, I've created my own application that stores cars that are currrently rented, customers, and the contracts.

The admin is able to add:
  -the cars that are up for rent + information about that specific car
  -the customers list + their prhone number
  -the contract between the customer and the care they have rented.

If a specific field is selected by the admin, it can be deleted:
